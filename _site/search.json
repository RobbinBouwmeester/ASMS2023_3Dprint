    "text": "3D printing, or additive manufacturing, is a fabrication method that creates three-dimensional objects by depositing materials layer-by-layer, based on a digital model. Models can be printed in a wide range of materials, including polymers, metals, and ceramics. The process begins with a 3D CAD model, which is then sliced into thin layers. 3D printers follow these slices, building the object from the bottom up. Advantages of 3D printing include rapid prototyping, customizability, and “unorthodox” geometries difficult to obtain by traditional manufacturing methods.\nThis exhibit showcases 3D printed mass spectrometer parts, custom laboratory equipment, and instructive teaching aids. The designs with their description are available on this website. If using any of these designs in your own work, make sure the material is compatible with the conductivity requirements and environment of the application, including temperature, pressure, and exposure to chemicals or solvents. We hold no responsibility for any harm and/or damage caused by the models on this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n- - analytical-column-storage-and-transport-box\n\n\n- - lc-fitting-union-holder\n\n\nI - thermofisher-scientific-lcms-tool-kit\n\n\nJ - levered-nut-knurl-for-viper-fitting\n\n\nK - evosep_hamilton_final.stl\n\n\nL - oven-door-v5.stl\n\n\ncontact - 3d-printed-sorbent\n\n\ncontacted - bottle-holders-for-inverted-drying-of-solvent-bottles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmitted by: Steven Williams\n\n\nAffiliation: Thermo Fisher Scientific\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral description: This box can be used to store or transport analytical columns to prevent damage.\n\n\nDescription of material: Recommend printing in PETG, required no assembly and does not require supports if printed in the orientation with the top of the lid on the build surface.

It allows the tip container to be used in the Hamilton STAR/STARLet and Nimbus platforms. It also allows the tip container to fit into any place that a standard 96-well deep-well container will fit, including the centrifuges. While not only does this allow for us to create automated methods, it also provides for a better extraction process, as the centrifugation process is noticeably better when the tip containers are locked into place rather than in a bed that is slightly too large.\n\n\nDescription of material: material: PETG color: black method of printing: FDM finishing: none assembly: none\n\n\nLicense: CC-BY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmitted by: Shane Karnik\n\n\nAffiliation: Pyxant Labs/ImaBiotech\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral description: Oven Door v5.stl This is a replacement door for the Shimadzu oven chamber. The factory doors can be broken fairly easily, and is problematic because there is a sensor that will keep the column from heating up if the door is not closed. This replacement allows us to put a new door on that is compatible with the built-in sensors. It also has a physical latch that bypasses the built-in latch to ensure that even if that latch is not functioning, the door will remain in-place during use.\n\n\nDescription of material: material: PLA color: Grey method of printing: FDM finishing: none assembly: none\n\n\nLicense: CC-BY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmitted by: DAYA RAJU ADYE\n\n\nAffiliation: NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF PHARMACEUTICAL EDUCATION AND RESEARCH, GUWAHATI.\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral description: 3D printing has emerged as a novel technology for advanced analytical sample preparation techniques. 3D printing enables the prototyping of devices at a low cost. SPE and LLE 3D printed devices have been made in the last couple of years cost-effectively. These successful applications of the new sample preparation method provide a new strategy for the bioanalysis of compounds from complex biological matrices. Exploring new extraction techniques is a trend in analytical chemistry and biomedicine. In the present study, we fabricated our own indigenous native filament using PVA along with Eudragit® RSPO, pH-independent polymer, and plasticizer TEC using the HME technique to enable a customized filament followed by 3D printed sorbent for the extraction of small molecules. The extracted samples were further analyzed using LC-MS/MS. We successfully extracted hydrocortisone from human plasma using a 3D printed sorbent and analyzed it using a validated LC-MS/MS method. The extraction efficiency was &gt;80%. New cost effective extraction techniques using 3D sorbents are one of the most revolutionary techniques in bioanalytical sciences. Our developed 3D sorbent is a milestone that can aid in the development of analytical extraction techniques.\n\n\nDescription of material: Eudragit® RSPO and PVA were weighed and mixed in a ratio of 1:1 (w/w) with the addition of triethyl citrate (TEC) (8.5 %w/w) as a plasticizer and extruded through a co-rotating twin-screw hot-melt extruder (HAAKE MiniLab II Thermo Scientific, UK) at 60 rpm at a temperature of 120 °C. The average diameter of the extruded filament should be 6.0 cm of extruded length and maintain an acceptable diameter of 2.80 (±0.03) mm for further FDM mediated 3DP, which is in agreement with the diameter of the print-core nozzle, i.e., 2.85 mm.\nComputer-aided design (CAD) software SOLIDWORKS (SOLIDWORKS-2019, US) was used to design the prototypes of the 3D sorbent and exported as stereolithography (STL) file. The CAD file dimension of the designed 3D sorbent was 15.0 mm length, 5.0 mm width, 1.5 mm internal cut radius (up to the length), 1.0 mm thickness, and 1.62 mm internal arch used to cut through the thickness. A cylindrical-shaped flake was chosen as the design of the 3D printed sorbent, which made it easy to insert inside the Eppendorf tube. The STL file format contains the desired dimensions of the 3D sorbent needed for the 3D printer slicer software (Ultimaker Cura Version 4.2.1, Singapore) to slice the objects and convert them into a G-code file format. The printing parameters were as follows: layer height, 0.1 mm; in-fill density, 100% (to avoid void formation); infill pattern, triangle; printing temp., 140 C; build-plate temperature, 60 C; printing speed, 70 mm/s; fan speed, 70%; print-core nozzle diameter, 0.4 mm; and total printing time,4min/sorbent. The 3D printed sorbent was printed using a 3D printer (Ultimaker 3, Ultimaker, Germany) using the FDM technology.\nThe dimensions of the designed cylindrical 3D printed sorbents were 15.0 mm length, 5.0 mm width, 1.5 mm internal cut radius (up to the length), 1.0 mm thickness, and 1.62 mm internal arch (used to cut through the thickness). The cylindrical flake-like geometry provides a larger surface area for better adsorption on a smaller volume space; the small volume space makes it easy to insert the sorbent in a regular Eppendorf tube. As mentioned, the prototype 3D sorbent was cylindrical in shape, slightly yellowish in colour, characteristic odour, non-fragile, and rigid in texture. Surface strandlines were visible at the sorbent surface, which may be due to layer-by-layer extrusion printing.\n\n\nLicense: CC-BY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmitted by: James Hunnicutt and Alan Jarmusch\n\n\nAffiliation: National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), National Institutes of Health (NIH)\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral description: Holder to safety dry LC solvent bottles in an inverted position\n\n\nDescription of material: Fused deposition modeling using PETG\n\n\nLicense: CC-BY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n? - lysis-bead-dispenser-for-barocycler-tubes\n\n\n? - pocket-pipette-tip-packs\n\n\nM - plate-press-stand-(plate-press-stand-v2.stl)\n\n\nN - tube-holder-for-hamilton\n\n\nO - y-cap\n\n\nP - ashwood-labs-high-voltage-test-fixture-1\n\n\nQ - spin96—peptide-sample-clean-up-device-for-stagetips\n\n\nT - microarray-mold\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmitted by: Steven Williams\n\n\nAffiliation: Children’s Medical Research Institute\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral description: A bead dispenser for use with barocycler tubes and 1 mm lysis beads.

You can print the exchangeable tip holders in the colour theme of the tip volume used by the supplying vendor, for example, grey for 10 uL, yellow for 200 uL and blue for 1000 uL. The lid can be attached to the body by placing a M2*8 set nut into the body and using an 8mm M2 screw through the lid. There is also space to insert 2mm diameter x 1mm deep magnets in the lid to help it stay clipped closed but this is not necessary.\n\n\nLicense: CC-BY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmitted by: Shane Karnik\n\n\nAffiliation: Pyxant Labs/Imabiotech\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral description: This is a print created to help users put caps onto their 96-well sample plate. It allows a user to place the plate into a cutout surrounded by guide rails. The user then puts the cap mat on the plate, then uses a rolling pin to firmly press the caps into position. The cutout keeps the plate firmly in place and the rails ensure that the user does not accidentally flip-over their sample plate during the capping process. This makes it faster, safer, and more efficient to cap plates before analysis.\n\n\nDescription of material: Material: PETG Color: black Method of Printing: FDM Finishing: None Assembly: None\n\n\nLicense: CC-BY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmitted by: Shane Karnik\n\n\nAffiliation: Pyxant Labs/Imabiotech\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral description: This is a print that we designed for the Hamilton system.

At one end the 3D printed body provides a cavity for potting a high resistor, cable and connector terminations. The completed assembly is designed to slide as a sleeve around then end of a Tektronix P6015A high voltage probe. It safely covers all HV connections and holds the probe in a stable position.\n\n\nDescription of material: Body is Printed in Black PLA with FFF (Fused Filament Fabrication). Breakaway supports used where needed. No post finishing. The completed assembly that this 3D printed body is used in has a connector, an HV resistor and HV leads added. The HV lead terminations are then potted.\n\n\nLicense: CC-BY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmitted by: Mark Larance\n\n\nAffiliation: The University of Sydney\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral description: We aimed to design a 96-well device for use in deep-well centrifuges to increase throughput and consistency when processing StageTips for peptide cleanup, while also minimizing the likelihood of cross-contamination. Our device (Spin96) addresses these issues and was designed with two bottom configurations to allow for a quick changeover between washing and elution steps. Several different plastics for the 3D-printing of Spin96 were tested for durability and usability, with high impact polystyrene (HIPS) chosen for its durability and ease of printing. To optimize the Spin96 protocol, an ideal force of 1000 g was determined as the minimum force required to efficiently pass liquid through StageTips with the Spin96. The protocol for processing SDB-RPS StageTips was also optimized to minimize centrifugation time without compromising the method (see Harney et al. 2019. J Proteome Res. 18(5):2228-2240. DOI: 10.1021/acs.jproteome.9b00090).\n\n\nDescription of material: The Spin96 components were exported as STL files for slicing and printing with a layer height of 0.14 mm. Sliced models were printed using HIPS Natural Black/Gray filament on a Zortrax M200 Plus. Printing on the Zortrax M200 Plus was performed according to the high-quality HIPS profile with either maximum infill (used for the holders, wash-bottom and bottom components), or low infill (used for the top component). Print settings used were: (extruder temperature 255 °C, build-plate temperature 80 °C, chamber temperature 40 °C, fan speed 20%, layer height 0.14 mm, print speed 3600 mm/min, retraction distance 0.5 mm, retraction speed 1800 mm/min, infill percentage 95%, use support with maximum overhang angle of 45° and use raft with 5 mm offset). Each part is printed separately and assembled after removal of supports (see Harney et al. 2019. J Proteome Res. 18(5):2228-2240. DOI: 10.1021/acs.jproteome.9b00090).\n\n\nLicense: CC-BY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmitted by: Kayla Martinez\n\n\nAffiliation: UTSA\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral description: This device was made to serve as a cost-effective gelatin mold to assist in sample preparation of brain homogenate for sulfatide analysis using LC-MS and TIMS-TOF. In addition to having high overall durability and chemical resistance, the mold can withstand temperatures of -80 degrees celsius with no damage to the mold’s structure. The mold’s custom dimensions and overall design make it easy to remove the gelatin without any breakage or tearing.\n\n\nDescription of material: The mold was created using polyethylene terephthalate glycol (PTEG) using UTSA Makerspace’s fused filament fabrication 3D printer. The material comes in various colors, but of the ones available I chose orange. No further assembly is required once the mold has been 3D printed, though it is recommended to ensure that it has no bumps or access material on the surface before using it.\n\n\nLicense: CC-BY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR - scale-sciex-6600-qtof\n\n\nS - rat-pd-(final_rat.stl)\n\n\nU - neoantigen-presented-by-hla-molecule\n\n\nU? - 3d-lc-ms-run\n\n\nV - covid-spike-and-membrane-(surface)\n\n\nW - giant-flagellum-(surface)\n\n\nX - nucleosome-(cartoon)\n\n\nY - alf-protein-structure-(cartoon),-gold-plated-brass-screwed-to-a-black-wooden-base-(so-maybe-more-“art”-than-science?)\n\n\nZ - mass-spectrum-becomes-a-protein-molecular-structure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmitted by: Steven Williams\n\n\nAffiliation: Children’s Medical Research Institute\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral description: This is a scale model of a Sciex 6600 QTOF Mass Spectrometer.\n\n\nDescription of material: The body is printed white, while the top and front panel are printed in blue, the source is printed in grey.

These antigens are later used as part of vaccine (as peptides or RNA, like the COVID-19 vaccine) or as cellular immunotherapy (using the T-cells that recognize these antigens), to treat cancer patients that have these mutations.\nLink for the file: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/qowxu1yxe62n7u7/AADtbXEimBVTWTrWAm4sS0P6a?dl=0\n\n\nDescription of material: Used PDB structure and ChimeraX to create the 3D printable structure\n\n\nLicense: CC-BY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmitted by: Robbin Bouwmeester\n\n\nAffiliation: nan\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral description: nan\n\n\nDescription of material: nan\n\n\nLicense: CC-BY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmitted by: Robbin Bouwmeester\n\n\nAffiliation: nan\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral description: nan\n\n\nDescription of material: nan\n\n\nLicense: CC-BY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmitted by: Robbin Bouwmeester\n\n\nAffiliation: nan\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral description: nan\n\n\nDescription of material: nan\n\n\nLicense: CC-BY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmitted by: Robbin Bouwmeester\n\n\nAffiliation: nan\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral description: nan\n\n\nDescription of material: nan\n\n\nLicense: CC-BY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmitted by: Magnus Palmblad\n\n\nAffiliation: nan\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral description: nan\n\n\nDescription of material: nan\n\n\nLicense: CC-BY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmitted by: Luis Schachner\n\n\nAffiliation: Genentech, Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral description: The 3D printed sculpture I wish to display is a stunning representation of the transformation of a mass spectrum into a molecular structure. The sculpture showcases a seamless blend of art and science, bringing together the two disciplines in a visually striking way. As an additional artistic medium, sculpture offers a unique opportunity to explore the three-dimensional nature of scientific data and brings the data to life in a tangible way.\nThis sculpture has significant utility for science as well. By visually demonstrating the transformation of a mass spectrum into a molecular structure, the sculpture offers a powerful tool for communicating complex scientific concepts. It can help scientists and non-scientists alike to better understand how mass spectrometry works and the insights it can offer into molecular structures. Additionally, the sculpture can be used to demonstrate the potential of 3D printing technology in scientific research and education.\nOverall, the 3D printed sculpture represents an exciting opportunity to showcase the intersection of art and science in a way that is both visually captivating and scientifically informative. It has the potential to inspire curiosity and imagination in viewers and to encourage further exploration of the potential of 3D printing technology in scientific research and education.\n\n\nDescription of material: 3D-Printed in nylon and painted with a bronze finish.

While only these DESI having been demonstrated, and LTP integration in progress, the end user can remix and reuse the ambient source for other purposes. Additionally, any expensive commercial positioners can be replaced with printed or machined solutions for spot profiling analysis, but for imaging, an additional investment is needed for an array of motorized linear stages as described in greater detail elsewhere:\nZemaitis KJ, Izydorczak AM, Thompson AC, Wood TD. Streamlined Multimodal DESI and MALDI Mass Spectrometry Imaging on a Singular Dual-Source FT-ICR Mass Spectrometer. Metabolites. 2021;11(4):253.\n\n\nDescription of material: Printed by fused deposition modeling (FDM) this source was originally created on a consumer grade printer (Creality Ender 3) in PLA. Later versions with subtle modifications to the original design to adapt different linear positioners are now printed in ABS on a Prusa i3 Mk3. The material, layer height, nozzle width, etc. will change based upon the printer used, and the end user needs to optimize for best print quality.\nThe model uses brass inserts for non-galling threads that are heat set into the printed parts, this forms strong connections and modelled parts are built around commercial accessories (e.g., Bruker Daltonics online nanospray adapter). While a common accessory for certain spectrometers (e.g., FTICR MS), we acknowledge not every instrument (e.g., FTICR, TOF, IT) was equipped with a legacy online nanospray source, however, this can be replaced by a printed solution. Given the heat produced within the Apollo II source block, careful consideration should be completed for material choice. The source mounts directly to the Apollo II source and uses the existing atmospheric pressure ionization inlet with a capillary extension. The source and assembly are described in greater detail elsewhere:\nZemaitis KJ, Wood TD. Integration of 3D-printing for a desorption electrospray ionization source for mass spectrometry.

Online separations and desalting enabled analysis of complex samples with minimal deleterious effects from ion suppression. These improvements were realized without offline sample preparation or the complex instrumentation required to couple HPLC or CE online with MS. To demonstrate the practical utility of the cartridge, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) were detected quantitatively from tap water with sub-ppt detection limits in less than 10 minutes.\n\n\nDescription of material: The cartridge is printed with a Prusa Mini+ using black Fiberology polypropylene filament. Ultimaker adhesion sheets are used and the print bed is not heated. The nozzle diameter is 0.25mm and the layer height 0.1mm. After the print is done, supports and brim are removed with tweezers and scalpel and the print sonicated in 50/50 water/methanol for 10 minutes. Copper wires are attached at the rear of the bottom section for electrical connections and platinum wires are inserted into the liquid reservoirs. The spray substrate is inserted into the top section and attached to the bottom section.\n\n\nLicense: CC-BY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmitted by: Steven Williams\n\n\nAffiliation: Children’s Medical Research Institute\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral description: This clip can be used to hold down the source activation button on a Sciex Optiflow source, which allows you to use a column set up that does not require the Sciex column holder, which may not suit all applications.\n\n\nDescription of material: Printed in PLA, no assembly or finishing required.\n\n\nLicense: CC-BY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmitted by: Steven Williams\n\n\nAffiliation: Children’s Medical Research Institute\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral description: This clip can be used to hold down the source activation button on a Sciex ZenoTOF OptiFlow Source, which allows you to use a column set up that does not require the Sciex column holder, which may not suit all applications.\n\n\nDescription of material: Printed in PLA, no assembly or finishing required.\n\n\nLicense: CC-BY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmitted by: Steven Williams\n\n\nAffiliation: Children’s Medical Research Institute\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral description: This model is useful when servicing the ion optics rail of a Sciex 6600 QTOF as it prevents the rail from rolling on the bench while working on it.\n\n\nDescription of material: Printed in PLA, no assembly or finishing required.

    "text": "3D printing, or additive manufacturing, is a fabrication method that creates three-dimensional objects by depositing materials layer-by-layer, based on a digital model. Models can be printed in a wide range of materials, including polymers, metals, and ceramics. The process begins with a 3D CAD model, which is then sliced into thin layers. 3D printers follow these slices, building the object from the bottom up. Advantages of 3D printing include rapid prototyping, customizability, and “unorthodox” geometries difficult to obtain by traditional manufacturing methods.\nThis exhibit showcases 3D printed mass spectrometer parts, custom laboratory equipment, and instructive teaching aids. The designs with their description are available on this website.\nIf using any of these designs in your own work, make sure the material is compatible with the conductivity requirements and environment of the application, including temperature, pressure, and exposure to chemicals or solvents. We hold no responsibility for any harm and/or damage caused by the models on this page.\n\n\n\n\n\nA - printable-framework-for-ambient-ionization-on-commercial-bruker-daltonics-instruments\n\n\nB - nanoesi-emitter-holder-cartridge\n\n\nC - custom-nano-esi-holder-and-high-resolution-faims-holder-enables-ims-on-bruker-amazon-ion-trap\n\n\nD - application-of-3d-printed-tools-for-customized-open-port-probe-electrospray-mass-spectrometry\n\n\nE - electrokinetic-stacking-cartridge-for-paper-spray-ms\n\n\nF - button-clip-for-zenotof-optiflow-source\n\n\nF - optiflow-source-button-clip\n\n\nG - mass-spec-rail-horse\n\n\nH - low-temperature-plasma-probe-for-in-vivo-aims-and-msi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmitted by: Kevin Zemaitis\n\n\nAffiliation: Pacific Northwest National Laboratory\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral description: The printed source is an inexpensive way to produce reproducible geometries for desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) and more recently low-temperature plasma (LTP) with minimal time and monetary investment. While only these DESI having been demonstrated, and LTP integration in progress, the end user can remix and reuse the ambient source for other purposes. Additionally, any expensive commercial positioners can be replaced with printed or machined solutions for spot profiling analysis, but for imaging, an additional investment is needed for an array of motorized linear stages as described in greater detail elsewhere:\nZemaitis KJ, Izydorczak AM, Thompson AC, Wood TD. Streamlined Multimodal DESI and MALDI Mass Spectrometry Imaging on a Singular Dual-Source FT-ICR Mass Spectrometer. Metabolites. 2021;11(4):253.\n\n\nPrinting remarks: Printed by fused deposition modeling (FDM) this source was originally created on a consumer grade printer (Creality Ender 3) in PLA. Later versions with subtle modifications to the original design to adapt different linear positioners are now printed in ABS on a Prusa i3 Mk3. The material, layer height, nozzle width, etc. will change based upon the printer used, and the end user needs to optimize for best print quality.\nThe model uses brass inserts for non-galling threads that are heat set into the printed parts, this forms strong connections and modelled parts are built around commercial accessories (e.g., Bruker Daltonics online nanospray adapter). While a common accessory for certain spectrometers (e.g., FTICR MS), we acknowledge not every instrument (e.g., FTICR, TOF, IT) was equipped with a legacy online nanospray source, however, this can be replaced by a printed solution. Given the heat produced within the Apollo II source block, careful consideration should be completed for material choice. The source mounts directly to the Apollo II source and uses the existing atmospheric pressure ionization inlet with a capillary extension. The source and assembly are described in greater detail elsewhere:\nZemaitis KJ, Wood TD. Integration of 3D-printing for a desorption electrospray ionization source for mass spectrometry.

To achieve this capability, our lab designed and printed a cartridge that would firmly hold the nanoESI emitter while being positioned with a ring stand and x, y, z manual linear stage. High temperature resin was used to allow for compatibility with mass spectrometer inlet temperatures exceeding 200 degrees Celsius.\nThe cartridge prints in a single piece with minimal supports and post processing.\n\n\nPrinting remarks: Formlabs high temp V2 resin on formlabs form 3 SLA 3d printer.

EK stacking improved detection limits 2-3 orders of magnitude with broad analyte compatibility. Online separations and desalting enabled analysis of complex samples with minimal deleterious effects from ion suppression. These improvements were realized without offline sample preparation or the complex instrumentation required to couple HPLC or CE online with MS. To demonstrate the practical utility of the cartridge, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) were detected quantitatively from tap water with sub-ppt detection limits in less than 10 minutes.\n\n\nPrinting remarks: The cartridge is printed with a Prusa Mini+ using black Fiberology polypropylene filament. Ultimaker adhesion sheets are used and the print bed is not heated. The nozzle diameter is 0.25mm and the layer height 0.1mm. After the print is done, supports and brim are removed with tweezers and scalpel and the print sonicated in 50/50 water/methanol for 10 minutes. Copper wires are attached at the rear of the bottom section for electrical connections and platinum wires are inserted into the liquid reservoirs. The spray substrate is inserted into the top section and attached to the bottom section.\n\n\nLicense: CC-BY\n\n\nDownload: Download 3D file\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmitted by: Steven Williams\n\n\nAffiliation: Children’s Medical Research Institute\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral description: This clip can be used to hold down the source activation button on a Sciex ZenoTOF OptiFlow Source, which allows you to use a column set up that does not require the Sciex column holder, which may not suit all applications.\n\n\nPrinting remarks: Printed in PLA, no assembly or finishing required.\n\n\nLicense: CC-BY\n\n\nDownload: Download 3D file\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmitted by: Steven Williams\n\n\nAffiliation: Children’s Medical Research Institute\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral description: This clip can be used to hold down the source activation button on a Sciex Optiflow source, which allows you to use a column set up that does not require the Sciex column holder, which may not suit all applications.\n\n\nPrinting remarks: Printed in PLA, no assembly or finishing required.\n\n\nLicense: CC-BY\n\n\nDownload: Download 3D file\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmitted by: Steven Williams\n\n\nAffiliation: Children’s Medical Research Institute\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral description: This model is useful when servicing the ion optics rail of a Sciex 6600 QTOF as it prevents the rail from rolling on the bench while working on it.\n\n\nPrinting remarks: Printed in PLA, no assembly or finishing required.

This peptide induces an immune response in patients and is used today for treating patients. Using mass spectrometry and Immunopeptidomics we purify the peptides presented on MHC to identify tumor antigens, some of them derived from mutations (and called neo-antigens), like this example. These antigens are later used as part of vaccine (as peptides or RNA, like the COVID-19 vaccine) or as cellular immunotherapy (using the T-cells that recognize these antigens), to treat cancer patients that have these mutations.\nLink for the file: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/qowxu1yxe62n7u7/AADtbXEimBVTWTrWAm4sS0P6a?dl=0\n\n\nPrinting remarks: Used PDB structure and ChimeraX to create the 3D printable structure\n\n\nLicense: CC-BY\n\n\nDownload: Download 3D file\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmitted by: Shane Karnik\n\n\nAffiliation: ImaBiotech/Pyxant Labs\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral description: Educationnel pieces to leverage the use of whole body animal-tissue imaging as a powefull tools for localizing compounds of biological interest with molecular specificity and high resolution.

It allows a user to place the plate into a cutout surrounded by guide rails. The user then puts the cap mat on the plate, then uses a rolling pin to firmly press the caps into position. The cutout keeps the plate firmly in place and the rails ensure that the user does not accidentally flip-over their sample plate during the capping process. This makes it faster, safer, and more efficient to cap plates before analysis.\n\n\nPrinting remarks: Material: PETG Color: black Method of Printing: FDM Finishing: None Assembly: None\n\n\nLicense: CC-BY\n\n\nDownload: Download 3D file\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmitted by: Shane Karnik\n\n\nAffiliation: Pyxant Labs/Imabiotech\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral description: This is a print that we designed for the Hamilton system.

Our device (Spin96) addresses these issues and was designed with two bottom configurations to allow for a quick changeover between washing and elution steps. Several different plastics for the 3D-printing of Spin96 were tested for durability and usability, with high impact polystyrene (HIPS) chosen for its durability and ease of printing. To optimize the Spin96 protocol, an ideal force of 1000 g was determined as the minimum force required to efficiently pass liquid through StageTips with the Spin96. The protocol for processing SDB-RPS StageTips was also optimized to minimize centrifugation time without compromising the method (see Harney et al. 2019. J Proteome Res. 18(5):2228-2240. DOI: 10.1021/acs.jproteome.9b00090).\n\n\nPrinting remarks: The Spin96 components were exported as STL files for slicing and printing with a layer height of 0.14 mm. Sliced models were printed using HIPS Natural Black/Gray filament on a Zortrax M200 Plus. Printing on the Zortrax M200 Plus was performed according to the high-quality HIPS profile with either maximum infill (used for the holders, wash-bottom and bottom components), or low infill (used for the top component). Print settings used were: (extruder temperature 255 °C, build-plate temperature 80 °C, chamber temperature 40 °C, fan speed 20%, layer height 0.14 mm, print speed 3600 mm/min, retraction distance 0.5 mm, retraction speed 1800 mm/min, infill percentage 95%, use support with maximum overhang angle of 45° and use raft with 5 mm offset). Each part is printed separately and assembled after removal of supports (see Harney et al. 2019. J Proteome Res. 18(5):2228-2240. DOI: 10.1021/acs.jproteome.9b00090).\n\n\nLicense: CC-BY\n\n\nDownload: Download 3D file\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmitted by: Kayla Martinez\n\n\nAffiliation: UTSA\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral description: This device was made to serve as a cost-effective gelatin mold to assist in sample preparation of brain homogenate for sulfatide analysis using LC-MS and TIMS-TOF. In addition to having high overall durability and chemical resistance, the mold can withstand temperatures of -80 degrees celsius with no damage to the mold’s structure. The mold’s custom dimensions and overall design make it easy to remove the gelatin without any breakage or tearing.\n\n\nPrinting remarks: The mold was created using polyethylene terephthalate glycol (PTEG) using UTSA Makerspace’s fused filament fabrication 3D printer. The material comes in various colors, but of the ones available I chose orange. No further assembly is required once the mold has been 3D printed, though it is recommended to ensure that it has no bumps or access material on the surface before using it.\n\n\nLicense: CC-BY\n\n\nDownload: Download 3D file"
